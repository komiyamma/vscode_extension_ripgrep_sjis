# rg-sjis

This is the grep to hit not only UTF8 but also Japanese SJIS(cp932).
When grep is done with Visual Studio Code, sjis cannot be detected if the files are a mixture of utf8 and sjis.   
This extension is made detectable.

## Requirements

Windows system. I think it's about Win7 or later. Maybe.
.NET Framework 4.5.2 and above.

## Known Issues

Problems occur when launching multiple Visual Studio Codes.

### 0.2.3

A draft version.
